    <h1>Uraio Shopping</h1>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Product Manager</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Uraio is an innovative e-commerce startup designed to help SMEs in Nigeria and across Africa establish an online presence. The platform supports local traders with tools to showcase their products, connect with buyers, and grow their businesses through an intuitive and scalable online marketplace.</p>

    <h3>Project Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simplifying Product Uploads for Non-Tech-Savvy Users:</strong> We designed a product listing flow that reduced onboarding time from 45 minutes to under 12, while capturing necessary product metadata.</li>
      <li><strong>Hybrid Search & Discovery Experience:</strong> We built a dual interface: structured Amazon-style search for detailed filtering, and informal WhatsApp-like browsing to cater to varied shopping habits.</li>
      <li><strong>Combating Distrust in Online Transactions:</strong> We embedded escrow logic and buyer reviews directly into the product pages to enhance credibility and reduce drop-offs by skeptical users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <p>PHP, HTML/CSS, MySQL</p>
