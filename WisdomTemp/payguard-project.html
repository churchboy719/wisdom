    <strong>Payguard</strong> is Nigeria’s leading online escrow platform designed to build trust in peer-to-peer online transactions. It provides a secure middle-layer for buyers and sellers, holding funds in escrow until agreed conditions are met, thus mitigating fraud and building confidence in digital commerce.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Project Objective</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    The core mission of Payguard was to redefine how Nigerians approach online trade—by removing the fear of scams and ensuring both buyers and sellers are protected. The product needed to support seamless workflows on both <strong>web and mobile</strong>, with fast transaction resolution, user verification, and transparent dispute resolution.
