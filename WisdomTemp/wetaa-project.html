    <strong>Wetaa</strong> is a multi-vendor SaaS solution designed for restaurants, bars, and cafes to streamline high-volume, in-house ordering using real-time group chat and order management technology. The app empowers vendors to manage dynamic order queues, communicate with cashiers instantly, and handle customer traffic with precision and clarity—all from a single dashboard.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Project Objective</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    The vision for Wetaa was to eliminate bottlenecks in crowded dine-in environments, replacing chaotic verbal orders with a smooth digital ordering and cashier communication system. The platform needed to support multiple restaurants and bars under one SaaS infrastructure, ensuring each vendor retained a unique environment, branding, and user flow while leveraging a shared scalable backend.

  <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Product Management Challenges</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Multi-Vendor Architecture:</strong> Building a system that could securely handle multiple vendor instances while maintaining performance integrity and user isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> Integrating Socket.IO to facilitate frictionless, real-time chat between vendors and their cashiers, especially during high-order surges.</li>
    <li><strong>QR Code Ordering:</strong> Implementing QR-based access for customers, allowing seamless cart retrieval and order placement without requiring sign-ins or downloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Ownership:</strong> Ensuring clarity on order responsibility by automatically assigning attending cashiers, reducing duplicate processing and human errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Notification Logic:</strong> Balancing urgency and user experience by designing tiered push notification behaviors—persistent alerts for new orders vs. single ring notifications for general messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> Building a subscription model with trial, monthly, and yearly options, coupled with an automated deactivation system upon expiry.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">My Role</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
    As the <strong>Project Owner and Full-Stack Developer</strong>, I led the end-to-end product lifecycle—from ideation and UX wireframing to backend logic, deployment, and marketing strategy. I coordinated the design of user flows for both web and mobile, set up the SaaS architecture, and managed vendor onboarding strategies to drive adoption. Tech stack includes <strong>Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Socket.IO, Firebase, and Paystack</strong>.
